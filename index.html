  <br>
  <font size = "1">Our company is built on the belief that sports make people better and that doing whatâ€™s right is ultimately what makes us successful. These values have been engrained in our business since our founding in 1948 and were carried forward and reinforced for the last 35 years by our Executive Chairman Ed Stack, who built this business from just two stores to what it is today.</font>

  <font size = "1">Our team, approximately 50,000 strong, worked diligently to create a safe shopping experience for our athletes, whether they shopped in store, online, or picked up at curbside. Our ability to operationalize curbside pickup in two days is a testament to our determined and high-performing culture.To show our appreciation for all our hardworking and dedicated store and distribution center (DC) teammates, we implemented a premium pay program starting in mid-April of 2020. We will continue to focus on supporting our teammates because they really are the heart of our company.
